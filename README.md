# Offline File Sharing Web App

## Overview

This web app enables users to share files without needing an internet connection by operating entirely over a local network. It is designed for environments where network connectivity is limited or unavailable, such as rural areas. The app allows seamless file transfers by connecting devices to the same Wi-Fi or hotspot.

The inspiration for this project came from my father’s shop, where customers frequently need to share files for printing. Due to frequent network issues in the village, traditional file-sharing methods like email or cloud services were unreliable. This app provides a practical solution by allowing local file sharing without internet.

## Features

- **No Internet Required**: Works over a local network (Wi-Fi or hotspot).
- **Simple UI**: Customers can upload or download files with just a few clicks.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Works on any device with a browser (smartphones, tablets, laptops).
- **Efficient File Transfer**: Quick and easy file sharing between devices connected to the same network.

## How It Works

1. The app runs locally on your laptop.
2. Both your laptop and the customer’s device must be connected to the same Wi-Fi or hotspot.
3. The customer enters the IP address displayed on your laptop into their device’s browser.
4. The customer can then upload or download files by clicking "Receive" or "Upload."

## Installation

To run the app locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/offline-file-sharing-app.git
   
## Usage

1. **Upload Files:**
   - Customers can upload files directly from their device by selecting the "Upload" button.
2. **Recieve Files:**
   - Customers can download shared files by selecting the "Receive" button.

## Future Enhancements

  - Add user authentication for secure file transfers.
  - Implement progress bars for file uploads and downloads.
  - Improve the UI for a more user-friendly experience.
